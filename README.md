# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
The objective of this data science project involves examining customer details like demographics, service usage, tenure, and other factors to forecast if a customer is likely to discontinue their subscription with the telecommunications company. This prediction of "churn" aims to identify patterns or indicators that lead to customers leaving the services. By grasping the elements influencing churn, the company can proactively implement strategies to retain customers.
# Conclusion
Insights gleaned from the exploratory data analysis are as follows:

1. Senior citizens tend to have a lower rate of discontinuing services compared to younger customers.
2. Single or independent customers show a higher likelihood of discontinuation.
3. Satisfaction levels are higher for streaming services than for features like online backup and device protection, correlating with a lower churn rate for streaming.
4. Longer tenure relates to a lower likelihood of churn, especially for customers with a tenure shorter than 5 months.
5. Short-term, month-to-month contracts link to a higher churn rate compared to longer contract durations (one or two-year contracts).
6. Customers with higher monthly charges and lower total charges are prone to churn, suggesting a potential need for reduced monthly fees to curb churn.
7. Crucial predictors for churn prediction include tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and total charges, highlighted by their significance in predicting customer churn.
